# 2D Elastic Wave Equation Simulation (deal.II)

This repository implements a 2D elastic wave equation solver using the finite element library deal.II.
The time integration is performed explicitly by the central difference method, and the displacement
field is output as VTU files at each time step for visualization.

---

## Overview

- Uses $Q_1$ (linear) finite elements for the displacement vector $(u_x, u_y)$.
- The spatial domain is a square subdivided 6 times uniformly.
- Two materials are defined by `material_id`, each having different physical properties:
  density $\rho$, and LamÃ© parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$.
- Time integration uses an explicit central difference scheme.
- Results are saved in VTU format every 10 time steps for post-processing.

## Mathematical Model

### Elastic Wave Equation

The 2D elastic wave equation is given by the PDE:

$$
\rho \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{u}}{\partial t^2} = \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}
$$

where

- $\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_y)$ is the displacement vector,
- $\rho$ is the density,
- $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is the stress tensor, defined by Hooke's law for linear elasticity with LamÃ© parameters $\lambda, \mu$.

## Numerical Discretization and Time Integration

### Spatial Discretization

Using the finite element method, we approximate the displacement vector $\mathbf{u}$
with basis functions and assemble the stiffness matrix $K$ and mass matrix $M$.

---

### Time Integration: Explicit Central Difference Method

The time stepping scheme for the displacement vector is:

$$
\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \Delta t^2 M^{-1} (-K \mathbf{u}^n) + 2 \mathbf{u}^n - \mathbf{u}^{n-1}
$$

where

- $\mathbf{u}^n$ is the displacement vector at time step $n$,
- $\Delta t$ is the time step size,
- $M$ is the mass matrix, and $K$ is the stiffness matrix.

---

#### Derivation of the Scheme (Outline)

1. Starting from the semi-discretized equation in space:

$$
M \frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}}{d t^2} + K \mathbf{u} = 0
$$

2. Approximate the second time derivative by the central difference:

$$
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{u}}{d t^2} \approx \frac{\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - 2 \mathbf{u}^n + \mathbf{u}^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
$$

3. Substitute into the equation and rearrange:

$$
M \frac{\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - 2 \mathbf{u}^n + \mathbf{u}^{n-1}}{\Delta t^2} + K \mathbf{u}^n = 0
$$

4. Solve for $\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$:

$$
\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \Delta t^2 M^{-1} (-K \mathbf{u}^n) + 2 \mathbf{u}^n - \mathbf{u}^{n-1}
$$

## Code Structure

- The main functionality is implemented in the `ElasticWave` class.
- `setup_system()` initializes finite element spaces and boundary conditions.
- `assemble_system()` assembles the stiffness matrix $K$.
- `assemble_mass_matrix()` assembles the mass matrix $M$ and computes its inverse diagonal entries.
- `initialize_solution()` sets the initial displacement (e.g., Gaussian pulse).
- `time_step()` updates the solution using the explicit central difference scheme.
- `output_results()` writes the solution to VTU files.
